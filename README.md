A simply computer algebra system which could do some symbolic computation, 
such as calculating the derivative of a given function expression with variables.
## Introduction 
I had never learned anything about fundamentals of compiling before I finished this project, which probably makes these codes a little ugly.

After I reviewed them with a few knowledge of FOC, I found the function ```parse``` actually played a role of both tokenizer and parser, 
it definitely looks funny in engineering.

However, I still decied to put them into github. I had almost never wrote any profundity algorithm without a tutorial before I wrote them.
In other words, I nearly never thought independently in the past. 
I would like to use these codes in honor of my first independent thinking.
